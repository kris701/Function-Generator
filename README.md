This was a little project to make a function generator based on a random [old article i found](./oldguide.pdf). 
For it, i also got a little case for it all to fit in. It is capable of square, triangle and sine waves in four different frequency ranges from 0.25Hz all the way up to 250Hz.
The voltage that it can output ranges from 2-12v (depending on what waves you use).
You can draw about 1-2 amps out of it.
